# Three body problem animated

Animation of three massive bodies acting freely under gravity in flat space. I solved the second order differential equation obtained trhough Newton's law of gravity numerically using SciPy's 'odeint' function. I then plotted and animated its motion using matplotlib. 

I have attached two examples of the animated motion in the form of mp4 files. Example one is a solar system style setup with one star like mass and two planet like masses. Example two contains 3 bodies, all of which have similar masses.
