# Three body problem animated

Animation of three massive bodies acting freely under gravity in flat space. I solved the second order differential equation obtained trhough Newton's law of gravity numerically using SciPy's 'odeint' function. I then plotted and animated its motion using matplotlib. 

The code to solve the differential equations was taken from Gaurav Deshmukh's Medium article: https://towardsdatascience.com/modelling-the-three-body-problem-in-classical-mechanics-using-python-9dc270ad7767.
